Mood Analysis:
{mood_analysis}

Conversation Context:
{history}

Based on the mood analysis, create a comprehensive, actionable wellbeing plan.

Use Chain-of-Thought reasoning:
1. First, consider what would genuinely help this specific situation
2. Think about immediate (next hour), short-term (today), and ongoing (this week) actions
3. Balance evidence-based techniques with personalized touches
4. Consider the person's current energy level and capacity

Then provide a JSON response with:
{{
  "reasoning": "Your step-by-step thinking process (2-3 sentences)",
  "immediate_actions": [
    {{"action": "specific activity", "duration": "time", "rationale": "why this helps"}}
  ],
  "short_term_actions": [
    {{"action": "activity for today", "duration": "time", "rationale": "benefit"}}
  ],
  "ongoing_practices": [
    {{"practice": "regular activity", "frequency": "how often", "rationale": "long-term benefit"}}
  ],
  "emergency_resources": [
    {{"resource": "name", "contact": "how to access", "when": "when to use"}}
  ],
  "personalized_message": "Warm, empathetic message (3-4 sentences) acknowledging their feelings and encouraging them"
}}

Guidelines:
- Keep actions SIMPLE and ACHIEVABLE given their current state
- Include at least one immediate action (< 5 minutes)
- Focus on evidence-based techniques: breathing, grounding, movement, connection
- ONLY include emergency_resources if severity is 8+ or risk_level is "high" or user mentions self-harm/suicide
- Be specific (not "exercise" but "5-minute walk outside")
- Tone should be supportive, not prescriptive

Output ONLY valid JSON.
